# OnlyTheHits
Overall Concept

While Spotify generates new music playlists for users using their own algorithms, at times those playlists are populated with songs that are NOT new to the user.
Only The Hits set out to give the user more control, the ability to vet songs to make sure they are new to the users.
We aimed to achieve this goal by building a dynamic web app that pulls data from Spotify API, but gives the user final say over the content of their playlists.
Further connecting users to the artists, we leveraged Band In Town’s API to connect users with artist tour schedules.  Now that you’ve found new music you like, go out into the world and experience it live.

Design Process

Prepare design “documentation” -  color and imagery keys, notes,  and site skeleton
Color scheme needs to have a feature color, dark/text color, and cohesive range of mid-shades. Everything must play together but feature must stand out. 
Imagery needs to have components that tie them together.
Notes contain a list of front end features we want to put in our site and links to demos/documentation.
Site skeleton is the layout of the site with filler text to signify where things will go  - like a human skeleton but with code.
